1) WAP a program to add 2 hex numbers 7A and 46 and store sum at 98H and flags at 97H

2) same ques just display at 2 different output ports

3) WAP to meet following specs:
a. initialise the stack pointer register at XX99H
b. clear the memory location 90H to 9FH
c. load register pair B,D and H with following data: B = 0237H, D = 1242H, H = 4087H
d. push the contents of the register pair B,D and H on the stack
e. execute the program and verify memory locations 90H to 9FH

4) WAP to clear initial flags, load data byte FFH into accumulator and add 01H to byte FFH by using instruction ADI.
Mask all flags except carry flag at display at port 0.
Repeat the program by replacing the ADI instruction with INR and byte 01H with NOP instruction. Display result at port 1 and explain it
